# React-Three-Matter-JS

An exploration into using a simple ECS combining React-Three-Fiber with Matter-JS


## To Do

- Creating and removing components on the fly
- Shapes
- Sprites
- Data in files
- 
- Cameras as entities?

## Done
- Simple ECS Framework
- Integrate Matter JS Physics
- Show wireframes


## Questions

Renderable vs non-renderable entities?
Cameras could be entities, with a transform and camera componet, they would be non-renderable
As they don't represent an entity which renders to the screen, do we need to make that distinction?
